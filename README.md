# Generative NFT Art

## Introduction

The `generative-art-nft` repository is a library for creating generative art. It was developed for the purpose of creating NFT avatar & collectible projects. This library was used to generate the artwork for the [Sneaky Squirrels](https://github.com/rounakbanik) project. 

### Features

#### Generate over a million distinct images with less than 60 traits
The library allows you to generate images every distinct possible combination of your traits. For context, if you had trait art for a project like [Bored Apes](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/#/home), the library could generate upwards of 1.2 billion distinct apes.

#### Add rarity weights
The library also allows you to configure the image generation process in such a way that you have complete control over how rare each and every trait is.

#### Fuzzy friendly 
You can use this library even if you do not know how to program (in Python or otherwise). Do check out the [Tutorial](#) for more details on how to use (non-technical) and extend (technical) the library.
